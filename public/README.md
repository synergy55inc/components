# Backbone.Marionette.js: A Serious Progression

This code repository is the companion to my [advanced book on Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/marionette-serious-progression).

Even if you don't have the book, you can learn a lot from looking through the commit history. But if you're serious about wanting to master Marionette.js, I suggest you consider purchasing the book:  you'll save a lot of time if you don't have to figure out yourself what works well and what doesn't...

If you're interested, you can view a sample of the book at http://samples.leanpub.com/marionette-serious-progression-sample.pdf
