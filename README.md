# Backbone.Marionette.js: A Serious Progression (Server)

This code repository is the optional server component to my [advanced book on Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/marionette-serious-progression).

You can either:

* install Rails on your machine and use this server as the API;
* depoly this code remotely (e.g. on Heroku);
* develop your own API based on the specifications in the book.
